Assets

Run `gulp watch` when updating SCSS/Javascript and it will:
* convert from SCSS to CSS
* move the resulting CSS file to the `public/css` directory
* combine all Javascript assets that are referenced in the `gulpfile.js`
* move combined Javascript file (named `all.js`) to the `public/js` directory
